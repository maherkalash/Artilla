The creator of an account in Dubarah is the User. We collect information about the User and any members that he or she invites to join the Dubarah. 
We are committed to providing all our Users with exceptional service. As providing this service involves the collection, use, storage and disclosure of some personal information about you (our User), protecting your personal information is one of our highest priorities.
We will inform you of why and how we collect, use and disclose your personal information, and obtain your consent where required.
This Privacy Policy outlines the principles and practices we will follow in protecting your personal information. Our privacy commitment includes ensuring the accuracy, confidentiality, and security of your personal information and allowing you to request access to, and correction of, your personal information.
Please contact us at: website@dubarah.com if you have any questions regarding our privacy policy or practices, or require any additional information on any of the below topics.
This Policy applies to all sites, mobile applications, and other online services (collectively, Platform) made available by Dubarah. It does not apply to other websites to which we link.

KEY TERMS
Please review the Key Terms section in the Terms of Use.
1) HOW YOU PROVIDE YOUR CONSENT
We will obtain your consent to collect, use or disclose personal information (except where, as noted below, we are authorized to do so without consent). 
You can provide your consent electronically or it can be implied where the purpose for collecting, using or disclosing the personal information would be considered obvious and you voluntarily provide personal information for that purpose. Examples of this are when you post files to your account. We support audio files, embedded Video for YouTube or Vimeo, PDF�s, Office documents and photos. Please note that any member who has account access can view or download those files.
Consent may also be implied where you are given notice of your personal information being used for mail-outs, the marketing of new services or products, fundraising, and you do not opt-out. 
Subject to certain exceptions (listed below), you can withhold or withdraw your consent for MyBand.IO to use your personal information in certain ways. Your decision to withhold or withdraw your consent to certain uses of personal information may restrict our ability to provide a particular service or product. If so, we will explain the situation to assist you in making a decision. 
There are special circumstances where we may collect, use or disclose some of your personal information without your knowledge or consent, when we are permitted or required by law.

Information from Affiliates, Social Networking Sites, and other Non-affiliated Third Parties
We may collect information about you or others through Dubarah affiliates or through non-affiliated third parties. For example, you may be able to access the Platform through a social networking account, such as Facebook.

Information That is Passively or Automatically Collected
Device/Usage Information. We and our third-party service providers, which include ad networks and analytics companies including Crashalytics, may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about the computers or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Platform.

We may also track how frequently you access or use the Platform. We use this information (including the information collected by our third-party service providers) for Platform analytics (including to determine which portions of the Platform are used most frequently and what our users like/do not like), to assist in determining relevant advertising (both on and off the Platform), to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns, and as otherwise described in this Policy.
Location Information. When you use the Platform, we may collect general location information (such as IP address). If you install our mobile app, we may ask you to grant us access to your mobile device's geolocation data. If you grant such permission, we may collect information about your precise geolocation, and we may use that information to improve the Platform, including providing you with location-based features (e.g. for identification of Services available near you). To deliver customized content and advertising, we may share your location information with our agents, vendors, or advertisers. If you access the Platform through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this. See your device manufacturer's instructions for further details. If you disable certain functions, you may be unable to use certain parts of the Platform.
Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies. We and our third-party service providers may use cookies, clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other technologies that help us better understand user behaviour, personalize preferences, perform research and analytics, and improve the Platform. These technologies, for example, may allow us to tailor the Platform to your needs, save your password in password-protected areas, track the pages you visit, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Platform usage. We also use certain of these technologies to deliver advertisements through the Platform that may interest you. We or our third-party service providers also may use certain of these technologies in emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
We may also use local shared objects (also known as Flash cookies) to assist in delivering special content, such as video clips or animation. Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are not managed through your web browser. To learn more about how to manage Flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel.
You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but your browser may allow you to modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer. If you disable cookies, you may be prevented from taking full advantage of the Platform, because it may not function properly. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not affect flash cookies. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.

If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored marketing, you may visit the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada Opt-Out Tool  to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Platform, you may still receive advertising content even if you opt out of tailored advertising. In that case, the advertising content will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. If your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on the DAAC's website accessible by the above link.
When using a mobile application you may also receive tailored in-application advertising content. Each operating system, iOS for Apple devices, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices, provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application marketing content. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertising. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator.
6) SECURITY
We are committed to ensuring the security of personal information we receive from you, in order to protect it from unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, or disposal or similar risks.
We employ appropriate physical, procedural and technological security measures, which are reasonably designed to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure. Dubarah may use encryption, passwords, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. 
Disclaimer to Security. By consenting to the Terms and Conditions of the Site and hence the Privacy Policy, you acknowledge that no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure. We cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you provide to us and please be aware that you transmit such information to us at your own risk.
You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, keeping your log-in and password private, and not recycling passwords from other websites or accounts. Dubarah is not responsible for the unauthorized use of your information nor for any lost, stolen, compromised passwords, or for any activity on your Account via unauthorized password activity.
7) LINKS TO EXTERNAL PLATFORMS
The Platform may contain links to other websites or resources over which Dubarah does not have any control. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Dubarah of those external websites. You acknowledge that Dubarah is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that Dubarah is not responsible for the content of such external websites or the protection and privacy of information you provide while visiting such external websites.
8) UPDATING, DELETING, AND CORRECTING YOUR INFORMATION
You may review, correct and delete certain information about you by logging into the Platform and navigating to your preferences page in Your profile. You must promptly update your Account information if it changes or is inaccurate. Upon your request, we will close your Account and remove your profile information from view as soon as reasonably possible. We may retain information from closed Accounts in order to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations of any user, enforce our Terms of Use, and/or for any other purposes otherwise permitted by law that we deem necessary in our sole discretion. You should understand, however, that once you transmit User Content through the Platform, you may not be able to change or remove it. Once we have deleted or removed your Account, you agree that Dubarah will not be responsible to you for retaining information related to your Account.

We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you. You may opt out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you emails about your Account or any services you have requested or received from us.

12) CONSENT TO TRANSFER
Our computer systems are currently based in Canada, so your personal data will be processed by us in Canada, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create an Account with the Platform as a visitor from outside Canada, by using the Platform, you agree to this Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to Canada, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection of that required in the European Union or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Policy.
13) REFERRALS 
You may choose to invite Members or support staff to join Dubarah by sending invitation emails via our invite feature. Dubarah may store the email addresses you provide so that the respondents may be added to your account, to confirm orders/purchases and also to send reminders of the invitations.

<p class="c3"><span class="c2">ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">You and Dubarah agree that the Ontario Arbitration Act, 1991, S.O. 1991, c. 17 governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">This Section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between us including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising); and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve any and all disputes with Dubarah as follows:</span>
</p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Initial Dispute Resolution: Most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation. You can reach Dubarah&#39;s support department at support@Dubarah.com. The parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with the Dubarah support department, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Binding Arbitration: If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the Terms&#39; or Privacy Policy&#39;s formation, performance, and breach), the parties&#39; relationship with each other, and/or your use of the Platform shall be finally settled by binding arbitration.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Class Action Waiver: The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND Dubarah AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims: Notwithstanding the parties&#39; decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in province or federal court or in the Canadian Intellectual Property Office to protect its intellectual property rights (&quot;intellectual property rights&quot; means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court&#39;s jurisdiction.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">30-Day Right to Opt Out: You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending (from the email address you use on Dubarah) written notice of your decision to opt out to support@Dubarah.com with the subject line, &quot;ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.&quot; The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Platform, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Dubarah also will not be bound by them.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Changes to This Section: Dubarah will provide thirty (30) days&#39; notice of any changes to this section by posting on the Platform or sending you an email. Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on Dubarah.com or sent to you by email. Changes will apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day. If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on &quot;Changes to This Section&quot; is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled Arbitration and Class Action Waiver, and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Platform.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Survival: This Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your Account or the Platform.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c2">GOVERNING LAW</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c0">The Terms and the relationship between you and Dubarah shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the province of Ontario, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You agree that any claim or dispute you may have against Dubarah that is not subject to arbitration must be resolved by a court located in Toronto, Ontario, or a Federal Court located in Toronto, except as otherwise agreed by the parties. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Toronto, Ontario or the a Federal Court located in Toronto, for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes that are not subject to arbitration.
